# GitHub Basics

In this markdown file, I will be explaining what I learned from the GitHub introduction course as well as experimenting with 
different writing and formatting styles

## Git and GitHub

The course first started by explaining that a Git is a distributed Version Control System (VCS), which means it is a tool that is. 
serves to track changes to code and projects, collaborate, and share. GitHub is a way to use Git.

## GitHub Flow

I was then introduced to the GitHub workflow. I learned that **repositories** are where your project happens and that they are 
stored remotely in the cloud when created, so **cloning** is useful to create a copy of the repository on your computer. I also 
learned that **committing** and **pushing** are they way in which you add the changes made in your local machien to the remote 
repository in GitHub.

## GitHub Terms

The last section of the introduction introducted important terms in GitHub and details regarding them. I learned that 
**repositories** can be navigated through the GitHub dashboard and that they contain READMEs. I learned that **branches** are 
used on GitHub separate parts of your work that you do not want to merge with your final project yet. I learned that **forks**
are another way of copying a repository and are usuaully used to contribute to other people's work. I learned that 
**pull requests** are used to inform others on changes you want to implement and ask for feedback. I also learned that **issues** 
are a way to track current tasks that you want to complete on your project and let others know about. Finally, I learned that 
**markdown** can be used to style your issues, pull requests, and files.

## Wrapping Up

A few other topics which I learned about pertained to different ways of engaiging with the vast GitHub Community, which included 
**starring repositories**, **following users**, and **browsing GitHub Explore**. Everyhting is still new to me, but I am sure that 
as I continue to use GitHub and the features it has to offer I will gain comfortability in using GitHub and will gain a more clear
understanding of all its functions.
